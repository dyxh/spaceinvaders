The set of challanges for Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 are very different. 

Space Invaders/Asteroids:
   On the face of it a simple game like this should be easy enough for a 2 person team. But games can be made arbitrarily complex, so I'll leave the choice of complexity up to you. I would advice starting with a simple core and get it funcitoning and then adding more features/flair as time permits. 

Paint:
   There will be a lot of decisions to make about this. Raster vs Vector graphics. If you go with Vector I would advice looking into Pete's Diagrams library or something similar. How much functionality will you provide? It can be as simple as a stripped down MSPaint to a full fledged vector graphics suite. Again, design your project very carefully. Make it very modular so you can start with a basic renderer/tools core and add features as time permits. Will you allow for users to export/import images? In what format? Look into using javascript ports for that. Also look into SVG libraries etc for vector graphics. 

Decide carefully between these two. Feel free to ask any more questions. 
Also, both Asteroids and Paint are pretty popular options in the class. It will be interesting to see the different takes on them.
